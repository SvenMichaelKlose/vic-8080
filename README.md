8080-CPU emulator for the VIC with Ultimem expansion
====================================================

This is just a sketch of it to see how it could work
out.  So far it amounts to 2.8K compiled code and it
looks like the emulated code would run at least 5 to
10 times slower.

Requires GNU Make and CC65 to build.
